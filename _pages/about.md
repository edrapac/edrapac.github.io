Currently providing security consulting services for a variety of clients, deepening my knowledge of offensive security tactics, and occasionally updating this site!

About Me
======
Hi, I'm Emerson. I'm a multi disciplinary security professional, Track and Field athlete, Movie buff, and introverted Nerd. I love tasks that require thinking and analytics! I'm still not quite sure what I want to be when I grow up, but I'm incredibly thankful for the life I live and the ability to pursue my passions.
